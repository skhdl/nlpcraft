 * short-term history of the user input for a given user and data model - both acting as a compound key for the STM.
 * Every submitted user request that wasn't
 * rejected is added to the conversation STM as a list of {@link NCToken tokens}. Existing STM tokens with
 * the same {@link NCElement#getGroup() group} will be overridden by the more recent tokens from the same group.
 * Note also that tokens in STM automatically expire (i.e. context is "forgotten") after a certain period of time.
