/**
 * Control flow exception to skip current intent. This exception can be thrown by the intent
 * {@link NCIntentSolver.IntentCallback callback} to indicate that current intent should be skipped (even though
 * it was matched and its callback was called). If there's more than one intent matched the next best matching intent
 * will be selected and its callback will be called.
 * <br><br>
 * This exception becomes useful when it is hard or impossible to encode the entire matching logic using just
 * declarative intent DSL. In these cases the intent definition can be relaxed and the "last mile" of intent
 * matching can happen inside of the intent callback's user logic. If it is determined that intent in fact does
 * not match throwing this exception allows to try next best matching intent, if any.
