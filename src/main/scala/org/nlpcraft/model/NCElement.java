/**
 * Semantic model element.
 * <br><br>
 * An element is the main building block of the semantic model. A semantic element defines an entity
 * that will be automatically recognized in the user input either by one of its synonyms or values, or directly by
 * its ID.
 *
 * <h2>Synonyms</h2>
 * Synonyms are the key building blocks of the semantic element and used in the following methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #getSynonyms()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getExcludedSynonyms()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getValues()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each model element has one or more synonyms. Note that element ID is its implicit synonym so that even if no
 * additional synonyms are defined at least one synonym always exists. Each individual synonym is a whitespace
 * separated combination of:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>simple word,</li>
 *     <li>regular expression, or</li>
 *     <li>PoS tag</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that synonym matching for simple words is case insensitive and automatically
 * performed on <i>normalized and stemmatized forms</i> of such word and therefore the model
 * provider doesn't have to account for this in the synonyms themselves.
 *
 * <h3>Macro Expansions</h3>
 * Listing all possible multi-word synonyms for a given element can be a time consuming tasks. Macros together with
 * option groups allow for significant simplification of this process. Model provides a list of macros via
 * {@link NCModel#getMacros()} method. Each macro has a name in a form of {@code <X>} where {@code X} is
 * just any string, and a string value. Note that macros can be nested, i.e. macro value can include references
 * to another macros. When macro name {@code <X>} is encountered in the synonym it gets recursively replaced with
 * its value.
 *
 * <h3>Option Groups</h3>
 * Option groups are a simplified form of regular expressions that operates on a single word base. The
 * following examples demonstrate how to use option groups. Consider that the following macros are defined:
 * <table summary="" class="dl-table">
 *     <tr>
 *         <th>Macro Name</th>
 *         <th>Macro Value</th>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code <A>}</td>
 *         <td>{@code aaa}</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code <B>}</td>
 *         <td>{@code <A> bbb}</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code <C>}</td>
 *         <td>{@code <A> bbb {z|w}}</td>
 *     </tr>
 * </table>
 * Note that macros {@code <B>} and {@code <C>} are nested. Then the following option group expansions
 * will occur in these examples:
 * <table summary="" class="dl-table">
 *     <tr>
 *         <th>Synonym</th>
 *         <th>Expanded Synonyms</th>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code <A> {b|*} c}</td>
 *         <td>
 *             {@code "aaa b c"}<br>
 *             {@code "aaa c"}
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code <B> {b|*} c}</td>
 *         <td>
 *             {@code "aaa bbb b c"}<br>
*              {@code "aaa bbb c"}
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code {b|```NN```} c}</td>
 *         <td>
 *             {@code "b c"}<br>
 *             {@code "```NN``` c"}
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code {b|\{\*\}}}</td>
 *         <td>
 *             {@code "b"}<br>
 *             {@code "b {*}"}
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code a {b|*}. c}</td>
 *         <td>
 *             {@code "a b. c"}<br>
 *             {@code "a . c"}
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code a .{b,  |*}. c}</td>
 *         <td>
 *             {@code "a .b, . c"}<br>
 *             {@code "a .. c"}
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code a {{b|c}|*}.}</td>
 *         <td>
 *             {@code "a ."}<br>
 *             {@code "a b."}<br>
 *             {@code "a c."}
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code a {{{<C>}}|{*}} c}</td>
 *         <td>
 *             {@code "a aaa bbb z c"}<br>
 *             {@code "a aaa bbb w c"}<br>
 *             {@code "a c"}
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>{@code {{{a}}} {b||*|{{*}}||*}}</td>
 *         <td>
 *             {@code "a b"}<br>
 *             {@code "a"}
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 * </table>
 * Specifically:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code {A|B}}  denotes either {@code A} or {@code B}.</li>
 *     <li>{@code {A|B|*}}  denotes either {@code A} or {@code B} or nothing.</li>
 *     <li>Excessive curly brackets are ignored, when safe to do so.</li>
 *     <li>Macros cannot be recursive but can be nested.</li>
 *     <li>Option groups can be nested.</li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code '\'} (backslash) can be used to escape <code>'{'</code>, <code>'}'</code>, {@code '|'} and
 *         {@code '*'} special symbols used by the option groups.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Excessive whitespaces are trimmed when expanding option groups.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
 * Any individual synonym word that starts and ends with {@code "///"} (three forward slashes) is considered to be Java
 * regular expression as defined in {@link Pattern}. Note that regular expression can only span a single word, i.e.
 * only individual words from the user input will be matched against given regular expression and no whitespaces are
 * allowed within regular expression. Note also that option group special symbols <code>'{'</code>, <code>'}'</code>,
 * {@code '|'} and {@code '*'} have to be escaped in the regular expression using {@code '\'} (backslash).
 * <br><br>
 * For example, the following synonym {@code {foo|///[bar].+///}} will match word {@code foo} or any other strings
 * that start with {@code bar} as long as this string doesn't contain whitespaces.
 *
 * <h3>PoS Tags</h3>
 * Any individual synonym word that that starts and ends with {@code "```"} (three back ticks) in a form <code>```XXX```</code> is
 * considered to be a PoS (Part-of-Speech) tag that will be matched against PoS tag of the individual word in the
 * user input, where {@code XXX} is one of the
 * <a target=_ href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">Penn Treebank PoS</a> tags.
 * <br><br>
 * For example, the following synonym <code>{foo|{```NN```|```NNS```|```NNP```|```NNPS```}}</code> will match word {@code foo} or any
 * form of a noun.
