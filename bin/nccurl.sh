# Quick shortcut script for localhost testing with curl (w/o excessive command line).
#
# Usage:
# - 1st parameter is REST URL unique suffix (i.e. /signin) w/o leading '/'
# - 2nd parameter is JSON payload string
#
# Example usage:
#   $./nccurl.sh /signin '{"email": "admin@admin.com", "passwd": "admin"}'
#   $./nccurl.sh ask '{"acsTok": "OgJanjDzk", "txt": "Hi!", "mdlId": "nlpcraft.helloworld.ex"}'
#   $./nccurl.sh check '{"acsTok": "OgJanjDzk"}'
#
# For pretty JSON output pipe curl to 'python -m json.tool':
#   $./nccurl.sh check '{"acsTok": "OgJanjDzk"}' | python -m json.tool

curl -s -d"$2" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8081/api/v1/$1
