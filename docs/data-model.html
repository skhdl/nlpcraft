        <span class="section-title">Data Model Overview</span>
        <p>
            NLPCraft employs model-as-a-code approach where data model is simply an implementation of
            <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/nlpcraft/model/NCModel.html">NCModel</a> Java interface that can be developed using any JVM programming
            language like Java, Scala, Kotlin, or Groovy. Data model implementation defines:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How to interpret user input
            </li>
            <li>
                How to query or control a particular data source
            </li>
            <li>
                How to format the result back to the user
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note that model-as-a-code approach natively supports any software life
            cycle tools and frameworks in Java eco-system like various build tools, CI/SCM tools, IDEs, etc.
            In other words, you don't have to use awkward web-based tools to manage some aspects of your
            models - your entire model is part of your project source code.
        </p>

    <section>
        <span class="section-title">Data Model Lifecycle</span>
        <p>
            To deploy a data model you need to provide an implementation of
            <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/nlpcraft/model/NCModelProvider.html">NCModelProvider</a> - a simple
            interface that acts as a factory or a builder for one or more data models. This separation is
            important as it enables data probes to query data model provider about which models it supports
            without necessarily instantiating an actual data model which could be expensive, not idempotent
            and time-consuming operation.
        </p>
        <div class="bq info">
            <b>NCModelProviderAdapter</b>
            <p>
                Note that instead of implementing
                <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/nlpcraft/model/NCModelProvider.html">NCModelProvider</a> interface
                directly in most cases you can use a
                convenient
                <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/nlpcraft/model/NCModelProviderAdapter.html">NCModelProviderAdapter</a> adapter class.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            As described before the data models get deployed to and hosted by the data probes - a lightweight
            container whose job is to host data models and transfer requests between REST server and the data
            models. When a data probe starts it reads its configuration file <code>probe.conf</code> to see which models to
            deploy:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If property <code>modelProviders</code> is defined the data probe will try to deploy all models
                this property defines by their fully qualified class names.
            </li>
            <li>
                If property <code>jarsFolder</code> is defined the data probe will recursively scan for all JAR files in this
                folder and will try to find all implementations of
                <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/nlpcraft/model/NCModelProvider.html">NCModelProvider</a> interface
                and deploy their data models.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note that once deployed the data model is immutable. If you need to change the data model
            configuration or implementation, as in the development and testing phases,  you need to restart the
            probe to redeploy this data model.
