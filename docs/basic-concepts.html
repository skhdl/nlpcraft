        <span class="section-title">Basic Concepts</span>
        <p>
            Below we’ll cover some of the key concepts that are important for NLPCraft.
            Note that many of them will be covered in more details later in this guide.
        </p>

    <section id="sem-model">
        <span class="section-sub-title">Semantic Modelling</span>
        <p>
            The concept of <a target=wiki href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_data_model">semantic modeling</a>
            is at the core of NLPCraft capabilities. Semantic modelling
            (or semantic grammar) defines a formal way of how a natural language sentence can be understood
            and translated into actions. NLPCraft provides one of the most sophisticated tools and APIs
            for semantic modelling applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a target=wiki href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_data_model">Introduced</a> in mid-1970s the
            semantic grammar differs from the traditional approach that is
            based on the linguistic grammar which deals only with linguistic categories like
            nouns, verbs, etc. The easiest way to understand the difference between semantic grammar and a
            linguistic grammar is to look at the following illustration:
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/semmodel1.png">
            <figcaption><b>Fig 1.</b> Semantic vs. Linguistic Grammar</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            In Fig. 2 the lower and upper sentences are the same but they are parsed differently. Lower part is
            parsed using traditional linguistic analysis where each word is tagged with a PoS (Point-of-Speech) tag
            (e.g. <code>NN</code> for nous, <code>JJ</code> for adjective, and so on). The upper part, however, is
            parsed using semantic grammar and instead of strictly individual words being tagged, potentially multiple words form
            high-level semantic groups like <code>DATE</code> or <code>GEO</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a bit more formal way the semantic grammar is a type of grammar whose non-terminals are not
            generic structural or linguistic categories like nouns or verbs but rather semantic
            categories like <code>DATE</code> or <code>GEO</code> or <code>ENTITY</code>. Unlike linguist grammar
            the semantic grammar allows to easily resolve the standard ambiguities prevailing in linguistic grammar, e.g.:
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img style="width: 45%" class="img-fluid" src="/images/semmodel2.png">
            <figcaption><b>Fig 2.</b> Linguistic Ambiguity</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            In Fig. 3. even though the linguistic signatures of both sentences are almost the same, the
            semantic meaning is completely different.
            The resolution of such ambiguity in a linguistic approach will require very sophisticated
            context analysis (if and when it is available) and in many cases simply impossible to do deterministically.
            Semantic grammar on the other hand allows to cleanly resolve this ambiguity in
            a simpler and fully deterministic way.
        </p>
        <div class="bq info">
            <b>Named Entity Resolution <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Semantic Model</b>
            <p>
                An astute reader can notice the similarities between classic Named Entity Resolution (NER) and
                model elements. Indeed, both try to identify semantic categories rather than generic structural or
                linguistic categories.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there is a number of important distinctions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most of the modern NER implementations employ a statistical machine learning (ML) approach and
                    therefore require substantial training corpora to create the ML models in the first place.  That
                    limits such implementations only to a very generic, well-understood categories like TIME,
                    DATE or PERSON for which well-defined corpora data exists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Due to probabilistic nature of ML approach classic NER is often unreliable in a short-sentence,
                    command oriented interfaces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because of previous limitations standard NER is not suitable for domain-specific knowledge
                    areas where no large pre-existing data corpus exists.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's important to note that some NLP toolkits provide a variation of NER sometimes called a
                Normalized Named Entity Resolution (NNER) that is based on rule-based logic or semantic
                modeling. For example, DATE or CURRENCY named entities can be normalized by
                <a target=_ href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ner.html">Stanford CoreNLP</a>
                toolkit (which is one of the base NLP engines that NLPCraft can be
                <a href="/download.html#optional">configured</a> with).
            </p>
            <p>
                Assuming a simplified  NER terminology, one could argue that Semantic Modeling allows you to build
                your own <b>reliable named entity resolver</b> specific to your own domain area.

    <section id="stm">
        <span class="section-sub-title">Conversation <span class="amp">&amp;</span> STM</span>
        <p>
            NLPCraft provides automatic conversation context management right out of the box.


            Conversation management is based on the idea of short-term-memory (STM). STM is automatically
            maintained by NLPCraft per each user and data model. Essentially, NLPCraft "remembers"
            the context of the conversation and can supply the currently missing elements from its memory (i.e. from STM).
            STM implementation is also conveniently integrated
            with intent-based <a href="/apis/latest/org/nlpcraft/model/intent/NCIntentSolver.html" target=javadoc>intent solver</a>
            utility class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maintaining conversation state is necessary for effective context resolution, so that users
            could ask, for example, the following sequence of questions using example weather model:
        </p>
        <dl class="stm-example">
            <dd><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i>What’s the weather in London today?</dd>
            <dt>
                <p>
                    User gets the current London’s weather.<br/>
                    STM is empty at this moment so NLPCraft expects to get all necessary information from
                    the user sentence. Meaningful parts of the sentence get stored in STM.
                </p>
                <div class="stm-state">
                    <div class="stm">
                        <label>STM Before:</label>
                        <span>&nbsp;</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stm">
                        <label>STM After:</label>
                        <span>weather</span>
                        <span>London</span>
                        <span>today</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </dt>
            <dd><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i>And what about Berlin?</dd>
            <dt>
                <p>
                    User gets the current Berlin’s weather.<br/>
                    The only useful data in the user sentence is name of the city Berlin. But since
                    NLPCraft now has data from the previous question in its STM it can safely deduce that we
                    are asking about <code>weather</code> for <code>today</code>.
                    <code>Berlin</code> overrides <code>London</code> in STM.
                </p>
                <div class="stm-state">
                    <div class="stm">
                        <label>STM Before:</label>
                        <span>weather</span>
                        <span>London</span>
                        <span>today</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stm">
                        <label>STM After:</label>
                        <span>weather</span>
                        <span><b>Berlin</b></span>
                        <span>today</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </dt>
            <dd><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-right"></i>Next week forecast?</dd>
            <dt>
                <p>
                    User gets the next week forecast for Berlin.<br/>
                    Again, the only useful data in the user sentence is <code>next week</code> and <code>forecast</code>.
                    STM supplies <code>Berlin</code>. <code>Next week</code> override <code>today</code>, and
                    <code>forecast</code> override <code>weather</code> in STM.
                </p>
                <div class="stm-state">
                    <div class="stm">
                        <label>STM Before:</label>
                        <span>weather</span>
                        <span>Berlin</span>
                        <span>today</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stm">
                        <label>STM After:</label>
                        <span><b>forecast</b></span>
                        <span>Berlin</span>
                        <span><b>Next week</b></span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </dt>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Note that STM is maintained per user and per data model.
            Conversation management implementation is also smart enough to clear STM after certain
            period of time, i.e. it “forgets” the conversational context after few minutes of inactivity.
            Note also that conversational context can also be cleared explicitly
            via <a href="https://nlpcraft.docs.apiary.io" target="apiary">REST API</a>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="model-ds">
        <span class="section-sub-title">Models <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Data Probes</span>
        <p>
            When working with NLPCraft you’ll be most often dealing with two concepts you have already seen above:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Model</li>
            <li>Data Probe</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you haven’t done it already - we highly recommend to look over <a href="/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>
            guide which will give you a quick dive into how these concepts interconnect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Data Model</b> is essentially a small piece of Java/Scala/Groovy (or any other JVM-based language) code that
            you will need to develop that defines how to translate user input into specific actions for a specific data source.
            Even though it may sounds complex - in reality most models are fairly simple and can be developed rather quickly.
            Data model does not necessarily have to work with only one type of endpoint but it is a
            good practice to have different types of endpoints handled by different models.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Data Probe</b> is an application whose main purpose is to deploy and host user-defined data models.
            A separate application is required since often NLPCraft will be connected to a private data
            source (like corporate database, for example) and open connectivity to this database from the
            outside will not be possible - hence a need for a secure proxy type of application in
            between. Data probe is a secure application that employs end-to-end encryption, HTTP tunneling and router
            ingress-only connectivity. Each data probe can host multiple models, and you can have multiple
            data probes. Data probes can be deployed anywhere as long as there is an outbound connectivity,
            and are typically deployed in DMZ or close to your private data sources. Data probe can be
            launched in-process for easier development and testing or as a command line tool for production usage.
