        <span class="section-title">Overview</span>
        <p>
            NLPCraft is an <a href="/legal.html">open source</a> library for adding a natural language interface to any applications. Think
            Amazon Alexa that is developer friendly, can work with any private data source, and has no hardware or
            software lock-in while giving you more NLP powers.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note that NLPCraft is a pure software library and doesn't require any specific hardware.
            It also doesn't deal with voice-to-text conversion as we consider this problem solved outside
            of this project - NLPCraft simply accepts textual input irregardless of where it came from.
        </p>
        <p>
            How does it work in a nutshell?
        </p>
        <p>
            When using NLPCraft you will be dealing with three main components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#data-model">Data model</a></li>
            <li><a href="#data-probe">Data probe</a></li>
            <li><a href="#server">REST Server</a></li>
        </ul>

        </figure>
    </section>
    <section id="data-model">
        <span class="section-sub-title">Data Model</span>
        <p>
            NLPCraft employs model-as-a-code approach where data model is simply an implementation of <a target="javadoc" href="/apis/latest/org/nlpcraft/model/NCModel.html"><code>NCModel</code></a> Java interface that
            can be developed using any JVM programming language like Java, Scala, or Groovy.
            Data model implementation defines how to interpret user input, how to query or control a particular data source, and
            finally how to format the result back to the user. Model-as-a-code
            natively supports any software life cycle tools and frameworks in Java eco-system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically, declarative portion of the model will be stored in a separate JSON or YAML file
            for simpler modifications. There are no practical limitation on how complex or simple a model
            can be, or what other tools it can use. Most data models will also use intent-based matching
            provided by NLPCraft out-of-the-box.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's an example of the absolutely minimal data model that simply returns the same answer back
            for any user input:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: java">
        NCModelBuilder.newModel("id", "description", "1.0")
            .setQueryFunction(ctx -> NCQueryResult.text("Hello World!"))
            .build()
        </pre>
        <p>
            To use data model it has to be deployed into data probe.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="data-probe">
        <span class="section-sub-title">Data Probe</span>
        <p>
            Data probe is an application designed to securely deploy and manage data models.
            Each probe can deploy and manage multiple models and many probes can be connected to the REST server.
            The main purpose
            of the data probe is to separate data model hosting from managing REST calls from the clients.
            While you would typically have just one REST server, you may have multiple data probes deployed
            in different geo-locations and configured differently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data probes can be deployed and run anywhere as long as there is an outbound connectivity, and are
            typically deployed in DMZ or close to your target data sources: on-premise, in the cloud, etc. Data
            probe uses strong 256-bit encryption and ingress only connectivity for communicating with the REST server.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="server">
        <span class="section-sub-title">REST Server</span>
        <p>
            REST server (or a cluster of REST servers behind a load balancer) provides URL endpoint for user applications to securely query data sources using NLI via
            data models deployed in data probes. Its main purpose is to accept REST-over-HTTP calls from user applications,
            manage connected data probes, and route user requests to and from requested data probes.
        </p>

    <section id="chatbots-vs-alexa-siri">
        <span class="section-sub-title">Chatbots vs. Alexa/Siri/NLPCraft</span>
        <p>
            There's a subtle yet important difference between chatbot platforms and systems like Alex, Siri or NLPCraft.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many, if not most, of the chatbot systems, are designed for dialog driven conversations.
            In fact, it is chatbots that heavily promoted the term "conversational". These systems allow to
            script or otherwise design a long-winded flow of simple questions and answers to determine the
            user's intent - hence the notion of the conversational interface. For many simple use cases this
            leads to a relatively straightforward implementation and sometimes a long Q&A is a necessary approach.
            However, this type of system suffers badly from <em>parasitic dialogs</em> - the condition where long Q&A sessions
            induced by this design feel contrived, cumbersome and unnatural to the actual users resulting in a
            significant reduction of chatbot adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alexa, Siri, Goole Assistant or NLPCraft concentrate on the understanding of more complex, nuanced
            natural language, often referred to as a spoken or free-form natural language. While these systems
            may not be as simple as basic chatbots they dramatically minimize or even eliminate the parasitic
            dialogs. These systems enable true natural language command-oriented control where unnecessary
            dialogs reduced to a minimum and users can get to the desired result in the shortest, the most efficient way.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the additional unique characteristics of NLPCraft is that it is hardware or software
            independent. You are not locked in into iOS or Android or Amazon AWS ecosystems.
        </p>

    <section id="nlpcraft-vs-opennlp">
        <span class="section-sub-title">NLPCraft vs OpenNLP/StanfordNLP</span>
        <p>
            NLPCraft uses both <a href="https://opennlp.apache.org/">Apache OpenNLP</a> and
            <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/">Standford CoreNLP</a> as its basic NLP engine (configurable as either one).
            Basic NLP engine is responsible for tokenization, lemmatization and optional named entity recognition.
            NLPCraft uses these in its own processing workflow including advanced semantic modeling and intent-based matching.
